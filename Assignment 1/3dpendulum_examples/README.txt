The two folders contain 2 examples of forward dynamics simulation.
Together, they hold all steps needed for building your own model.

1: Pendulum in 3D with one segment and 2 DOF joint.
   Both DOFs can be actuated with a torque.
2: Pendulum in 3D with two segments and a total of 5 DOFs.
   A solution is shown that prevents singularities.
